def analyze_job_description(job_text):
    # Extract key skills and requirements
    skills_pattern = r'\b(?:Python|JavaScript|SQL|Testing|Automation|QA|SDET)\b'
    skills = re.findall(skills_pattern, job_text, re.IGNORECASE)
    return Counter(skills)

def optimize_resume(resume_text, job_requirements):
    # Suggest resume improvements
    missing_skills = []
    for skill, count in job_requirements.items():
        if skill.lower() not in resume_text.lower():
            missing_skills.append(skill)
    
    return {
        'missing_skills': missing_skills,
        'optimization_suggestions': generate_suggestions(missing_skills),
        'keyword_density': calculate_keyword_density(resume_text, job_requirements)
    }
```

### Application Tracker
```python
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class JobApplicationTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = sqlite3.connect('job_applications.db')
        self.create_tables()
    
    def add_application(self, company, role, date_applied, job_url, status='Applied'):
        cursor = self.db.cursor()
        cursor.execute('''
            INSERT INTO applications 
            (company, role, date_applied, job_url, status)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        ''', (company, role, date_applied, job_url, status))
        self.db.commit()
    
    def get_follow_up_reminders(self):
        # Return applications that need follow-up
        cursor = self.db.cursor()
        week_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)
        cursor.execute('''
            SELECT * FROM applications 
            WHERE status = 'Applied' AND date_applied < ?
        ''', (week_ago,))
        return cursor.fetchall()
```
