- **Win Rate**: 64% across 342 trades
- **Maximum Drawdown**: -12.4% (controlled risk exposure)
- **Volatility**: 18.2% annualized

#### Technical Implementation
```python
class MeanReversionStrategy:
    def __init__(self, lookback=20, threshold=2.0):
        self.lookback = lookback
        self.threshold = threshold
    
    def generate_signals(self, prices):
        rolling_mean = prices.rolling(self.lookback).mean()
        z_score = (prices - rolling_mean) / prices.rolling(self.lookback).std()
        return np.where(z_score < -self.threshold, 1, 
                       np.where(z_score > self.threshold, -1, 0))
```
