- User registration and login flows
- Core functionality testing
- Navigation and user interface
- Touch interactions and gestures
- Device orientation changes
- Network connectivity scenarios
- Background/foreground transitions
- Push notifications
- Device-specific features (camera, GPS, contacts)
- Performance on different devices
- Battery usage optimization
- Memory usage and leaks

Include test data requirements and device configurations.
```

### Cross-Platform Testing
```
Design cross-platform testing strategy for:

App: [App description]
Platforms: iOS and Android
Framework: [React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, etc.]

Create test plan covering:
- Platform-specific UI differences
- Native feature integration
- Performance comparison between platforms
- Platform-specific gestures and interactions
- Different screen sizes and resolutions
- OS version compatibility
- App store compliance requirements
- Platform-specific security considerations

Include device matrix and testing priorities.
```

## Mobile Web Testing

### Responsive Web Testing
```
Generate test cases for mobile web application:
