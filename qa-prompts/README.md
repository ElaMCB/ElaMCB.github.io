## Quick Start

1. **Choose a category** that matches your current testing need
2. **Copy the prompt** that best fits your scenario
3. **Paste into your AI tool** (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
4. **Customize** the prompt with your specific requirements
5. **Iterate** based on the AI's output

## Usage Tips

- **Be specific**: Include your technology stack, testing framework, and specific requirements
- **Provide context**: Share relevant code snippets, user stories, or error messages
- **Iterate**: Use follow-up prompts to refine and improve the AI's output
- **Validate**: Always review and test AI-generated code before using in production
