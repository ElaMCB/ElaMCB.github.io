- **CSS**: Modern CSS3, responsive design, consistent naming
- **JavaScript**: ES6+, vanilla JS preferred, well-commented
- **Python**: PEP 8 compliant, type hints where applicable
- **Documentation**: Clear, concise, with examples

### Testing Requirements
- All code changes should be tested
- HTML validation must pass
- Links must be functional
- Responsive design must work across devices
