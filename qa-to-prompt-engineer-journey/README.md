# Journey: QA Lead → Prompt Engineer in 4 Weeks

> **Value Prop**: "I turn vague requirements into reliable LLM features—measured, cost-optimal, shipped."

## Goal
Get interview-ready for a Prompt Engineer role in 4 weeks through a structured, high-impact learning plan.

## Plan Overview

This journey focuses on what hiring managers actually test:
1. **Prompt craft** - Writing effective prompts
2. **Eval & metrics** - Proving prompts work with data
3. **Domain transfer** - Adapting to new domains
4. **Tooling/automation** - Building production-ready systems
5. **Communication** - Articulating decisions with data

**Time Commitment**: ~10 hours/week (90-minute daily blocks)

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### [Week 1: Core Prompting & Mental Models](./week1/README.md)
**Goal**: Build reflex-level prompting hygiene

- Day 1: Prompt Engineering Guide + Playground replication
- Day 2: Mental models + Reddit ELI5 exercises
- Day 3: Failure modes & guardrails
- Day 4: Temperature & sampling deep-dive
- Day 5: **Mini-project**: Prompt A/B CLI → GitHub

### [Week 2: Evaluation, Data & Iteration](./week2/README.md)
**Goal**: Show you can prove a prompt is better, not just feel it

- Day 1: LLM evaluation frameworks
- Day 2: Metrics deep-dive (exact-match, BLEURT, BERTScore, LLM-as-judge)
- Day 3: Human-in-the-loop label UI (Streamlit)
- Day 4: Error analysis & prompt patches
- Day 5: **Case-study blog post**: "Improving summarization recall 72% → 91%"

### [Week 3: Domain Transfer & Advanced Patterns](./week3/README.md)
**Goal**: Prove you can jump domains and ship production-ready prompts

- Day 1: Domain exploration (medical, legal)
- Day 2: Prompt pattern catalog (RAG, reflection, tree-of-thought)
- Day 3: Tooling comparison (LangChain vs pure Python)
- Day 4: Cost & latency optimization
- Day 5: **Mini-hackathon**: Kaggle LLM competition

### [Week 4: Portfolio, Interview Stories & Offer Filter](./week4/README.md)
**Goal**: Package evidence so recruiters want to shortlist you

- Day 1: Portfolio site (Notion/GitHub Pages)
- Day 2: Behavioral stories (STAR+data format)
- Day 3: Mock interviews (free alternatives)
- Day 4: Compensation research & target list
- Day 5: Cold outbound (20 personalized LinkedIn messages)

## Ready-Mode Checklist

- [ ] Portfolio live
- [ ] 3 case studies with numbers
- [ ] GitHub pinned repos
- [ ] Resume bullet: "Improved LLM task X from A% → B% accuracy while cutting cost by C% via prompt optimization"
- [ ] Calendly link in email signature for recruiter calls

---

## Progress Tracking

- [Week 1 Progress](./week1/PROGRESS.md)
- [Week 2 Progress](./week2/PROGRESS.md)
- [Week 3 Progress](./week3/PROGRESS.md)
- [Week 4 Progress](./week4/PROGRESS.md)

## If You Only Have 30 Min/Day

Focus on:
1. Replicate one prompting guide example and push delta to GitHub
2. Tweet the lesson learned
3. Log metric in Notion

Do this for 30 days → you'll still be top 10% of applicants.

---

## Notes

- All projects should be pushed to GitHub (public repos)
- Case studies should be published on Medium/LinkedIn
- Track all experiments in a centralized Notion database
- Build in public - share learnings daily

**Go ship.**
