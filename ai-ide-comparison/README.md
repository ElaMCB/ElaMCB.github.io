# AI IDE Collection - Gotta Code 'Em All

A comprehensive, interactive comparison of 10 AI-powered development environments tested in real-world scenarios.

## Overview

After spending 100+ hours testing every major AI IDE, I built this interactive comparison to help developers choose the right AI coding assistant.

## Featured IDEs

### S-Tier
- **Cursor** - AI-first code editor with Composer and codebase understanding
- **Windsurf (Codeium)** - Agentic IDE with cascade flows, completely free

### A-Tier

## Features

- **Interactive Filtering** - Filter by price, tier, local models
- **Detailed Comparisons** - Pros, cons, pricing, features
- **Comparison Matrix** - Side-by-side feature table
- **Personal Recommendations** - Based on real-world testing

## My Verdict

**Best Overall:** Cursor ($20/mo) - Unmatched for professional development  
**Best Free:** Windsurf (Free) - Incredible value, agentic workflows  
**Best Privacy:** Void + Continue.dev (Free) - Run models locally
