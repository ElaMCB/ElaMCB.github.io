Remember, life is not a sprint but a marathon, so is the path to learning and growning.  Keep defining your short term goals (measurable) and strive hard to achieve them. (Eg. Getting better at competitive coding is not a measurable goal but achiving 2000 rating in Codechef is measurable)  Update everyday progress and submit a pull request.  (Optional) Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag and timely tweet your progress with #100DaysOfCode hashtag.  Try to add detailed description of what you did, add corresponding links, if you solve questions, you can add your codes in the same folder and provid a link in the README (not for active contests).  We start the marathon on January 1, 2020. feel free to add your goals beforehand (they can also be added later).  Benefits Coding will become a daily habit for you.  Every day that you consistently code, you’ll build momentum. That momentum will make it easier for you to learn more advanced topics.  The projects that you’ll build will be small in scope, so by the time you finish, you’ll have completed several of them — and gained a wide range of experience.  Your GitHub profile will look extremely active. And yes, hiring managers and recruiters do look at these.  You’ll get more comfortable contributing in open soruce. It will become a natural, ordinary thing to do.  You’ll have a pretty good reason to stop procrastinating and start coding every day.  Increase your efficiency by checking your daily progress and analysing it.  Compare your progress with others and surpass your limits in learning each day.  Recognition You will be provided with certificates on successful completiton of 100DaysOfCode. At the end of each month, goodies will be given to the top performers. A big surprise for the overall top performers in 100DaysOfCode. Note: Only the students in MNIT/ IIIT Kota/ NIT UK are elligible for prizes/ certificates.  Pre-requisites Markdown: You need to update your README in Markdown (a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax).
