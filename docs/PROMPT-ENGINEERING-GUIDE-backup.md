## Best Practices

### 1. Context is King
- **Always provide specific context** about your project, tech stack, and requirements
- Include relevant code snippets, error messages, and environment details
- Specify constraints (browser support, performance requirements, accessibility needs)

### 2. Iterative Refinement
- Start with a basic prompt, then refine based on results
- Ask for specific improvements: "Make this more accessible" or "Optimize for mobile"
- Build on previous responses: "Now add error handling to the previous solution"

### 3. Template Approach
- Create reusable prompt templates for common tasks
- Customize templates for your specific tech stack and requirements
- Share successful prompts with your team

### 4. Validation Strategy
- Always review AI-generated code for security issues
- Test thoroughly, especially edge cases
- Validate HTML, check accessibility, test across browsers
- Use AI for code review: "Review this code for potential issues"
