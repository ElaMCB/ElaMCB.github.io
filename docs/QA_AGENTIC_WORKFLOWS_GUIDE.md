## Introduction: Why Build Your Own Agents? {#introduction}

As a QA professional, you're already using agentic workflows in your IDE (like Cursor's code review agent). But what if you could create specialized agents that help with your specific daily tasks?

### The Problem
- **Repetitive Tasks**: Writing the same test cases, checking the same things every day
- **Time Constraints**: Not enough hours to test everything thoroughly
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Forgetting edge cases or missing important test scenarios
- **Context Switching**: Jumping between different tools and systems

### The Solution: Your Own Specialized Agents
Think of an AI agent as a **smart assistant that never gets tired** and can:
- Work 24/7 on repetitive tasks
- Remember all your testing patterns
- Learn from your work style
- Handle multiple tasks simultaneously
- Provide instant answers to common questions

### Real-World Impact
Based on research and practical implementations:
- **70% reduction** in manual testing time
- **10x faster** test case generation
- **95%+ bug detection** rate
- **487% ROI** demonstrated in healthcare QA case studies

## What Are AI Agents? (In Simple Terms) {#what-are-agents}

### Traditional Automation vs AI Agents

**Traditional Automation:**
- You write a script that does exactly what you tell it
- If something changes, the script breaks
- You must update it manually
- It can't adapt or learn

**AI Agents:**
- You tell it what you want to achieve (in plain English)
- It figures out how to do it
- It adapts when things change
- It learns from experience
- It can reason about problems

### The Five Key Abilities of AI Agents

1. **Perceive**: Understand what's happening (read code, analyze requirements, check system state)
2. **Reason**: Think about what needs to be done (decide what to test, identify risks)
3. **Act**: Do the work (generate tests, run checks, create reports)
4. **Learn**: Remember what worked and what didn't
5. **Collaborate**: Work with other agents or tools

### Types of Agents You Can Build

1. **Test Generator Agent**: Creates test cases from requirements
2. **Code Reviewer Agent**: Reviews code changes before commits
3. **Bug Analyzer Agent**: Investigates failures and suggests fixes
4. **Documentation Agent**: Updates test documentation automatically
5. **Chat Agent**: Answers questions about your codebase and processes
6. **Daily Standup Agent**: Prepares your daily status updates
7. **Regression Agent**: Runs smart regression tests based on changes

## Building Your First Agent: Step-by-Step {#building-first-agent}

### Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge (or willingness to learn)
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Internet connection (for initial setup)
- 30 minutes of time

### Option 1: Simple Chat Agent (Easiest Start)

#### What It Does
A chat agent that answers questions about your codebase, testing processes, and daily work.

#### Step 1: Install Ollama (Free Local AI)
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
winget install Ollama.Ollama

# Mac
brew install ollama

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### Step 2: Download a Model
```bash
# Download a small, fast model (about 4GB)
ollama pull llama3.2:1b

# Or a better quality model (about 7GB)
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

#### Step 3: Create Your Chat Agent
Create a file called `chat_agent.py`:

```python
import ollama
import os

class QAChatAgent:
    """Simple chat agent for QA questions"""
    
    def __init__(self, model="llama3.2:3b"):
        self.model = model
        self.context = self._load_context()
    
    def _load_context(self):
        """Load your QA knowledge base"""
        return """
        You are a helpful QA assistant. You help with:
        - Test case generation
        - Bug analysis
        - Testing best practices
        - Code review questions
        - Daily QA workflows
        """
    
    def ask(self, question):
        """Ask the agent a question"""
        prompt = f"{self.context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:"
        
        response = ollama.generate(
            model=self.model,
            prompt=prompt
        )
        
        return response['response']
    
    def chat(self):
        """Interactive chat mode"""
        print("QA Chat Agent - Type 'quit' to exit\n")
        
        while True:
            question = input("You: ")
            if question.lower() == 'quit':
                break
            
            print("\nAgent: ", end="")
            answer = self.ask(question)
            print(answer)
            print()

# Run the agent
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = QAChatAgent()
    agent.chat()
```

#### Step 4: Install Python Package
```bash
pip install ollama
```

#### Step 5: Run Your Agent
```bash
python chat_agent.py
```

**That's it!** You now have a working chat agent.

### Option 2: Test Generator Agent (More Advanced)

#### What It Does
Reads requirements or code and generates test cases automatically.

#### Create `test_generator_agent.py`:

```python
import ollama
import json

class TestGeneratorAgent:
    """Generates test cases from requirements"""
    
    def __init__(self, model="llama3.2:3b"):
        self.model = model
    
    def generate_tests(self, requirement_text):
        """Generate test cases from requirements"""
        prompt = f"""
        You are a QA test case generator. Given the following requirement, 
        generate comprehensive test cases in JSON format.
        
        Requirement:
        {requirement_text}
        
        Generate test cases with:
        - Test ID
        - Test Description
        - Test Steps
        - Expected Result
        - Priority (High/Medium/Low)
        
        Return as JSON array.
        """
        
        response = ollama.generate(
            model=self.model,
            prompt=prompt,
            format="json"
        )
        
        try:
            tests = json.loads(response['response'])
            return tests
        except:
            return [{"error": "Failed to parse response"}]
    
    def generate_from_file(self, file_path):
        """Generate tests from a requirements file"""
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            requirements = f.read()
        
        return self.generate_tests(requirements)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = TestGeneratorAgent()
    
    requirement = """
    Feature: User Login
    - User can login with email and password
    - User sees error message for invalid credentials
    - User can reset password
    """
    
    tests = agent.generate_tests(requirement)
    
    for test in tests:
        print(f"Test ID: {test.get('id', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"Description: {test.get('description', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"Priority: {test.get('priority', 'N/A')}")
        print("---")
```

### Option 3: Code Review Agent (Like Cursor, But Custom)

#### What It Does
Reviews code changes and provides feedback before you commit.

#### Create `code_review_agent.py`:

```python
import ollama
import subprocess
import sys

class CodeReviewAgent:
    """Reviews code changes before commit"""
    
    def __init__(self, model="llama3.2:3b"):
        self.model = model
    
    def get_diff(self):
        """Get git diff of changes"""
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "diff", "--cached"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True
        )
        return result.stdout
    
    def review(self, diff_text=None):
        """Review code changes"""
        if not diff_text:
            diff_text = self.get_diff()
        
        if not diff_text:
            return "No changes to review"
        
        prompt = f"""
        You are a QA code reviewer. Review the following code changes 
        and provide feedback on:
        1. Potential bugs
        2. Test coverage gaps
        3. Code quality issues
        4. Security concerns
        5. Best practices
        
        Code changes:
        {diff_text}
        
        Provide structured feedback.
        """
        
        response = ollama.generate(
            model=self.model,
            prompt=prompt
        )
        
        return response['response']
    
    def review_and_suggest_tests(self, diff_text=None):
        """Review code and suggest test cases"""
        review = self.review(diff_text)
        
        prompt = f"""
        Based on this code review:
        {review}
        
        Suggest specific test cases that should be written to test these changes.
        """
        
        response = ollama.generate(
            model=self.model,
            prompt=prompt
        )
        
        return {
            "review": review,
            "suggested_tests": response['response']
        }

# Usage: Run before git commit
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = CodeReviewAgent()
    review = agent.review()
    print(review)
    
    # You can add this as a git pre-commit hook
```

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = EnhancedQAChatAgent()
    agent.chat()
```

### Using Your Chat Agent

**Daily Use Cases:**
- "What test cases should I write for a login feature?"
- "How do I test API rate limiting?"
- "What's the best way to test this bug?"
- "Explain the difference between unit and integration tests"
- "Suggest edge cases for this feature"

**Teaching Your Agent:**
- "learn Our team uses Playwright for E2E tests"
- "learn We test on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari"
- "learn Our API uses JWT authentication"

**The agent remembers these and uses them in future answers.**

## Monday to Friday Agent Workflow {#monday-friday-workflow}

### Complete Weekly Agent Setup

Create `weekly_qa_agents.py`:

```python
import ollama
from datetime import datetime
import json

class WeeklyQAAgents:
    """Collection of agents for weekly QA work"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = "llama3.2:3b"
        self.agents = {
            "monday": self.monday_planning,
            "tuesday": self.tuesday_test_generation,
            "wednesday": self.wednesday_regression,
            "thursday": self.thursday_bug_analysis,
            "friday": self.friday_report
        }
    
    def monday_planning(self, tickets):
        """Monday: Week planning"""
        prompt = f"""
        Create a weekly QA test plan from these tickets:
        {tickets}
        
        Provide:
        1. Priority order

        return self._generate(prompt)
    
    def wednesday_regression(self, changes):
        """Wednesday: Smart regression"""

        Analyze these code changes:
        {changes}
        
        Recommend:
        1. Which test areas are affected
        2. Specific test cases to run

        4. Areas that can be skipped
        """
        return self._generate(prompt)

            return "Run Friday report agent"
        else:
            return "Weekend - no agents scheduled"

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agents = WeeklyQAAgents()
    
    # Example: Monday planning
    tickets = """
    - Ticket 123: Add user authentication
    - Ticket 124: Update payment processing
    - Ticket 125: Fix login bug
    """
    
    plan = agents.monday_planning(tickets)
    print(plan)
```

### Automation: Run Agents Automatically

Create a simple scheduler `agent_scheduler.py`:

```python
import schedule
import time
from weekly_qa_agents import WeeklyQAAgents

agents = WeeklyQAAgents()

def monday_morning():
    """Run Monday planning agent"""
    print("Running Monday planning agent...")
    # Your implementation here
    pass

def tuesday_morning():
    """Run Tuesday test generation"""
    print("Running Tuesday test generation agent...")
    pass

# Schedule agents
schedule.every().monday.at("09:00").do(monday_morning)
schedule.every().tuesday.at("09:00").do(tuesday_morning)
# ... etc

# Run scheduler
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)
```

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices {#troubleshooting}

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Agent Responses Are Slow
**Solution:**
- Use smaller models (llama3.2:1b instead of 3b)
- Run on GPU if available
- Cache common responses
- Use cloud API for faster responses

#### Issue 2: Agent Gives Wrong Answers
**Solution:**
- Provide more context in prompts
- Use better quality models
- Add examples to prompts
- Fine-tune on your specific domain

#### Issue 3: Agent Forgets Context
**Solution:**
- Implement memory system (like enhanced chat agent)
- Use conversation history
- Save important patterns
- Use vector databases for long-term memory

#### Issue 4: Setup Is Too Complex
**Solution:**
- Start with simplest agent (chat agent)
- Use pre-built solutions
- Follow step-by-step guides
- Ask for help in communities

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a chat agent, then expand
2. **Iterate**: Improve agents based on usage
3. **Document**: Keep notes on what works
4. **Share**: Teach others in your team
5. **Combine**: Use multiple simple agents instead of one complex one

### Security Considerations

- **Local Models**: Use Ollama for sensitive data
- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to git
- **Data Privacy**: Be careful with what you send to cloud APIs
- **Access Control**: Limit who can modify agents

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start Today**: Set up the simple chat agent (5 minutes)
2. **Use Daily**: Integrate into your workflow
3. **Expand Gradually**: Add one agent per week
4. **Share Knowledge**: Teach your team
5. **Iterate**: Improve based on feedback

### Resources

- **Ollama Documentation**: https://ollama.com
- **LangChain Tutorials**: https://python.langchain.com

## Conclusion

Building your own AI agents doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. Start with a simple chat agent, use it daily, and gradually expand. The key is to solve real problems you face every day.

Remember:
- **Free options exist**: Ollama, Hugging Face, etc.
- **Start simple**: Chat agent is easiest
- **Iterate**: Improve based on usage
- **Share**: Help your team learn

You're already using agentic workflows (like Cursor's code review). Now you can create specialized agents for your specific QA needs.
