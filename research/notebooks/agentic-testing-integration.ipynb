        "The evolution of AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities for autonomous software testing. This research explores the integration of agentic systems into testing workflows, examining both the utilization of existing general-purpose agents and the development of specialized testing agents. We investigate how autonomous agents can transform quality assurance from reactive testing to proactive, intelligent quality engineering through continuous monitoring, adaptive test generation, and autonomous issue resolution.\n",
