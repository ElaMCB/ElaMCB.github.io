        "## Abstract\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of testing methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on practical approaches for detecting hallucinations, measuring bias, and implementing safety validation frameworks in production environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "As Large Language Models become increasingly integrated into production systems, the need for robust testing methodologies has become critical. Traditional software testing approaches are insufficient for the non-deterministic nature of LLM outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Challenges in LLM Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Non-deterministic outputs** - Same input can produce different outputs\n",
        "2. **Hallucination detection** - Identifying factually incorrect information\n",
        "3. **Bias measurement** - Quantifying unfair or discriminatory responses\n",
        "4. **Safety validation** - Ensuring harmful content is not generated\n",
        "5. **Performance consistency** - Maintaining quality across different contexts\n"
