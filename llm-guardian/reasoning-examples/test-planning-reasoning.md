# Test Planning Reasoning Examples

This document demonstrates advanced AI reasoning patterns for systematic test planning and strategy development.

## Multi-Step Reasoning for E-commerce Application Testing

### Step 1: Architecture Analysis
```
APPLICATION: E-commerce platform with React frontend, Node.js API, PostgreSQL database

REASONING:
- Frontend: React SPA → Need component testing, user interaction flows
- API Layer: REST endpoints → Require API contract testing, data validation
- Database: PostgreSQL → Need data integrity, performance testing
- Integration Points: Payment gateway, inventory system → Critical failure points
```

### Step 2: Risk Assessment
```
HIGH RISK AREAS:
1. Payment Processing (Business Critical)
   - Financial transactions must be accurate
   - PCI compliance requirements
   - Third-party integration dependencies

2. User Authentication (Security Critical)
   - Password handling and storage
   - Session management
   - OAuth integrations

3. Inventory Management (Business Logic)
   - Stock level accuracy
   - Concurrent purchase handling
   - Real-time updates

IMPACT ANALYSIS:
- Payment failures → Revenue loss, customer trust
- Auth vulnerabilities → Security breaches, compliance issues  
- Inventory errors → Overselling, customer dissatisfaction
```

### Step 3: Test Prioritization Matrix
```
PRIORITY 1 (Critical Path):
- Payment flow end-to-end testing
- User registration and login
- Product purchase workflow
- Cart functionality

PRIORITY 2 (High Impact):
- Search and filtering
- Product catalog display
- User profile management
- Order history

PRIORITY 3 (Medium Impact):
- Wishlist functionality
- Product reviews
- Recommendation engine
- Admin dashboard
```

### Step 4: Specific Test Cases Generation
```
PAYMENT FLOW TEST CASES:

Positive Cases:
1. Complete purchase with valid credit card
2. Successful PayPal integration
3. Apply discount code during checkout
4. Guest checkout flow

Negative Cases:
1. Invalid credit card number
2. Insufficient funds scenario
3. Payment gateway timeout
4. Network interruption during payment

Edge Cases:
1. Multiple rapid purchase attempts
2. Cart modification during checkout
3. Session expiry during payment
4. Concurrent stock depletion

Security Cases:
1. SQL injection in payment forms
2. XSS attempts in user inputs
3. CSRF token validation
4. Rate limiting on payment attempts
```

### Step 5: Automation Strategy
```
AUTOMATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

Framework Selection:
- Playwright for E2E testing (cross-browser support)
- Jest for unit testing (React components)
- Supertest for API testing (Node.js integration)
- Artillery for performance testing

Implementation Approach:
1. Page Object Model for UI tests
2. API contract testing with schema validation
3. Database state management between tests
4. Parallel execution with proper test isolation

CI/CD Integration:
- Run unit tests on every commit
- E2E tests on pull requests
- Performance tests on staging deployment
- Security scans before production release

REASONING FOR TOOL SELECTION:
- Playwright chosen over Selenium for better reliability and speed
- Jest provides excellent React component testing capabilities
- Supertest integrates well with Node.js backend testing
- Artillery offers realistic load testing scenarios
```
