# Algorithmic Trading System

A systematic mean reversion trading strategy implemented with Python, featuring automated backtesting, risk management, and performance analytics.

## Strategy Overview

### Mean Reversion Strategy
**Core Hypothesis**: Asset prices tend to revert to their statistical mean over time, creating profitable trading opportunities when prices deviate significantly from historical averages.

**Key Components**:
- **Statistical Analysis**: Z-score based entry/exit signals
- **Risk Management**: Position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics and visualization
- **Automated Execution**: Systematic rule-based trading decisions

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Python 3.9+**: Core development language
- **pandas/numpy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **yfinance**: Market data acquisition
- **matplotlib/seaborn**: Data visualization and charting
- **scipy**: Statistical analysis and optimization
- **pytest**: Automated testing framework

## Strategy Details

### Signal Generation
1. **Moving Average Calculation**: 20-day and 50-day moving averages
2. **Standard Deviation Bands**: 2-sigma deviation bands around mean
3. **Z-Score Analysis**: Standardized price deviation measurement
4. **Entry Signals**: Price moves beyond 2-sigma threshold
5. **Exit Signals**: Price reverts to mean or stop-loss triggered

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: 2% risk per trade maximum
- **Stop Loss**: 3% maximum loss per position
- **Portfolio Limits**: Maximum 10% allocation per asset
- **Correlation Limits**: Avoid highly correlated positions
- **Drawdown Controls**: Reduce position sizes during drawdowns

### Performance Metrics
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measurement
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Worst peak-to-trough decline
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profit to gross loss
- **Calmar Ratio**: Annual return divided by maximum drawdown

## Implementation Highlights

### Data Pipeline
```python
class MarketDataPipeline:
    def __init__(self, symbols, start_date, end_date):
        self.symbols = symbols
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.end_date = end_date
        
    def fetch_data(self):
        """Fetch and validate market data"""
        data = yf.download(self.symbols, start=self.start_date, end=self.end_date)
        return self.validate_data(data)
        
    def validate_data(self, data):
        """Ensure data quality and completeness"""
        # Data validation logic
        return cleaned_data
```

### Strategy Engine
```python
class MeanReversionStrategy:
    def __init__(self, lookback_period=20, z_threshold=2.0):
        self.lookback_period = lookback_period
        self.z_threshold = z_threshold
        
    def generate_signals(self, prices):
        """Generate buy/sell signals based on mean reversion"""
        rolling_mean = prices.rolling(self.lookback_period).mean()
        rolling_std = prices.rolling(self.lookback_period).std()
        z_score = (prices - rolling_mean) / rolling_std
        
        signals = pd.Series(0, index=prices.index)
        signals[z_score < -self.z_threshold] = 1  # Buy signal
        signals[z_score > self.z_threshold] = -1  # Sell signal
        
        return signals
```

### Risk Management
```python
class RiskManager:
    def __init__(self, max_position_size=0.1, stop_loss=0.03):
        self.max_position_size = max_position_size
        self.stop_loss = stop_loss
        
    def calculate_position_size(self, signal, portfolio_value, volatility):
        """Calculate optimal position size based on risk parameters"""
        risk_adjusted_size = self.max_position_size / volatility
        return min(risk_adjusted_size, self.max_position_size)
```
